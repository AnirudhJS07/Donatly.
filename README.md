# Donatly.
Donatly is a project aiming at safeguarding the masses, that require any sort of blood or organ(s) or Oxygen Cylinders on an emergency, or a long term basis. We all are aware of the fact that almost every second somebody in the nation requires blood, and how one person's blood can save at least two lives, hence, for those who are eligible to donate blood, they should feel free to do so, as all they are doing is saving lives, which is contributing towards mankind.
