# Donatly

Donatly is a project aiming to safeguard the masses that require any sort of blood, organ(s), or oxygen cylinders on an emergency or long-term basis. We all are aware that almost every second somebody in the nation requires blood, and how one person's blood can save at least two lives. Donatly provides a platform to Donate/Request/Explore/Know more about donating blood/organ(s). That's our ultimate aim at Donatly.

## About Us

Donatly is a non-profit movement empowering awareness for blood and organ donation among people. It is created to inform individuals about critical conditions and provide them with an opportunity to donate blood or organs based on their choices. This is a safe space where people can read and get more information about organ and blood donations, the procedures involved, prerequisites, and the possible effects.
